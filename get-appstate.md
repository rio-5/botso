# Getting AppState for Nicaa: Chatbot Template

To use the Nicaa: Chatbot Template, you need to add the appstate to `appstate.json`. This project doesn't support login with credentials for safety reasons, as sharing credentials publicly poses security risks.

### For PC/Windows:

1. Open Chrome and go to [c3c-fbstate releases on GitHub](https://github.com/c3cbot/c3c-fbstate).
2. Scroll down to the "releases" section and download the latest version as a zip file.
3. After downloading, decompress the zip file.
4. Go to Chrome extensions, enable developer mode if it's disabled, and click "Load unpacked."
5. Choose the folder where the zip contents are decompressed and enable the extension.
6. Login to Facebook using your bot account only.
7. Open the extension and click "Copy to clipboard."

Now, head back to your project and paste the copied content into `appstate.json`. Your chatbot is almost ready!

### For Android/Mobile:

2. Scroll down to the "releases" section and download the latest version as a zip file.
3. After downloading, go to Kiwi browser extensions, enable developer mode if it's disabled, and click "Load unpacked."
4. Choose the zip file you downloaded and enable the extension.
5. Login to Facebook using your bot account only.
